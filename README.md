# RoboPi

We are creating a robot that has movable arms, a facial expression recognition camera, and a web app to be able to see the camera being used in real time.

## Goal

Our goal for this project is to create a robot that recognizes facial expressions when you come close enough, using OpenCV and a proximity sensor. We will use Python and the OpenCV library to create a program that will be able to tell if you are happy or sad. It will then proceed to perform different actions based on these expressions. Once it performs the actions the robot will ask the user if the robot had the correct guess and you would click a button that is attached to the robot’s hands. This will then log the data onto our web app and create a chart of how many times the robot guessed correctly or incorrectly. The web app will show a live camera feed from the robot’s eye camera which will show us who is in front of the camera.
